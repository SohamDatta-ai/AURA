#  **AURA**  
### *Always With You*

> **TL;DR:** AURA is a privacy-first, wearable AI that remembers our conversations, senses emotions, and lives *with* you ‚Äî not *in the cloud.*  
> Think **JARVIS meets Her**, but open-source, memory-driven, and actually personal.

**Tagline:** üåô *Always With You*

## ü§î Wait, Another AI Assistant?

Yeah, I know.  
*"Another AI assistant project. Great."*

But hear me out.

After using ChatGPT, Claude, Alexa, and Siri... I realized they all share the same flaw:  
they don‚Äôt **remember**, they don‚Äôt **feel**, and they definitely don‚Äôt **care**.

Every chat is *Groundhog Day.*  
No memory. No emotion. No context.  
Just another ‚ÄúHi, how can I help you?‚Äù on repeat.

So I thought:  
> *What if I built the one I actually wanted to talk to?*

## üéØ What Even Is AURA?

AURA is a **voice-first AI companion** that:

- üß† **Actually remembers** you ‚Äî not just the conversation  
- ‚ù§Ô∏è **Understands your state** ‚Äî tone, stress, emotion  
- üîí **Keeps your data yours** ‚Äî everything runs *locally*  
- ‚åö **Lives in a pendant** (eventually) ‚Äî for now, it‚Äôs humble Python magic

It‚Äôs equal parts:
> **25% JARVIS** ‚Äì always-on utility  
> **25% Samantha (*Her*)** ‚Äì emotionally intelligent  
> **25% Your best friend who remembers your coffee order**  
> **25% pure chaos and duct tape** ‚Äì because let‚Äôs be honest, it‚Äôs early days.

## üèóÔ∏è Under the Hood

### üß† Memory System (The Secret Sauce)

AURA doesn‚Äôt just ‚Äústore chat logs.‚Äù  
It builds **human-like memory layers**:

| Type | Example | Purpose |
|------|----------|----------|
| üß© Episodic | ‚ÄúRemember Tuesday‚Äôs bad meeting?‚Äù | Recall events |
| üß≠ Semantic | ‚ÄúSoham hates cilantro.‚Äù | Store facts |
| ‚öôÔ∏è Procedural | ‚ÄúWhen asked for workouts, respond in this format.‚Äù | Behavioral learning |
| üí¨ Conversational | Current session | Contextual continuity |

> It‚Äôs like your AI finally started paying attention in class.

---

### üíì Emotion Engine

AURA doesn‚Äôt just parse *text* ‚Äî it reads the *vibe.*

- üéôÔ∏è Voice tone ‚Üí stress, calm, energy  
- ‚ù§Ô∏è Heart rate ‚Üí via smartwatch data  
- üí¨ Text sentiment ‚Üí ‚ÄúI‚Äôm fine‚Äù ‚â† fine

And it adapts.  
If you‚Äôre stressed, it slows down.  
If you‚Äôre inspired, it keeps up.  
If you‚Äôre quiet‚Ä¶ it listens.

---

### üß± Privacy by Design

> No servers. No hidden APIs. No ‚Äúanonymous telemetry.‚Äù

Everything runs **on your device** ‚Äî local LLM, local storage, local memories.

| Layer | Tech | Purpose |
|-------|------|----------|
| üß† Model | Mistral 7B (via `llama.cpp`) | Local reasoning |
| üó£Ô∏è Voice | Coqui TTS | Natural speech |
| üéß Hearing | Whisper.cpp | Offline STT |
| üóÉÔ∏è Memory | SQLite + FAISS | Persistent recall |

It‚Äôs not the biggest model. But it‚Äôs *mine.*  
And it won‚Äôt sell my thoughts to the highest bidder.

## üöÄ Current Status

**Week 3 / 18** ‚Üí Early Dev Phase  
*(following a structured roadmap to sanity)*

### ‚úÖ Done
- Voice loop working üéôÔ∏è  
- Wake word detection: ‚ÄúHey AURA‚Äù  
- Conversation storage (SQLite DB)  
- Emotion detection prototype (accuracy TBD)

### üß© In Progress
- Cross-session memory  
- Context carryover  
- Latency reduction on low-end devices

### üó∫Ô∏è Roadmap

| Phase | Focus | Duration |
|-------|--------|-----------|
| **1** | Voice pipeline (core loop) | Weeks 1‚Äì4 |
| **2** | Memory + emotion integration | Weeks 4‚Äì6 |
| **3** | Mobile app + sync | Weeks 7‚Äì10 |
| **4** | Advanced memory graphs | Weeks 11‚Äì14 |
| **5** | Hardware pendant prototype | Weeks 15‚Äì18 |

## ‚öôÔ∏è Tech Stack (for the nerds)

| Component | Tool | Why |
|------------|------|-----|
| üß† Core Brain | Mistral 7B + llama.cpp | Local, performant, smart enough |
| üó£Ô∏è Speech-to-Text | Whisper.cpp | Offline, reliable |
| üîä Text-to-Speech | Coqui TTS | Expressive human-like output |
| üóÇÔ∏è Memory Store | SQLite + FAISS | Structured + vector recall |
| üì± Mobile | Flutter | Unified Android/iOS build |
| ‚åö Hardware | ESP32 | Small, efficient, hackable |

## üé¨ Demo Time

Coming soon üëÄ  
*(Week 4 goal: record a demo that doesn‚Äôt make me cringe.)*

> For now, imagine a tiny glowing pendant whispering back when you say,  
> ‚ÄúHey AURA, remind me why I‚Äôm doing this again?‚Äù  
> ‚Äî *And it actually remembers.*
